| gerund | inf |
| ---- | ---- |
| after certain verbs/likes and dislikes | after certains verbs (lol) |
| instead of noun | after many adj |
| after preposition | express purpose |
some can take both not changing meaning (ex : started raining/to rain)
some means big changes ex : stop + gerund = 2nd verb stopped. stop+inf stop something else to do the verb
(my personal tip : sounds good ?)
