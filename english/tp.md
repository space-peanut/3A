After ash's accident, his wife Martha is devastated. 
While she is mourning, her friend Sarah suggests her a software that will mimic Ash using all the data he left on the internet.
Martha is using it a lot, trying to comfort herself.
In the end, the chat bot calls martha.

## prediction
she stays in denial.
the company that made the software manipulates maria in making her spend a lot of money, or even do illegal acts.
All the AIs of the deads will take over the world
